\section{Problem Outline}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{What is the problem?}
\structure{Goal:} We wish to reconstruct some generated signal $\hat{x}$ that has been distorted by some error and convolution processes. \newline \vspace{.5cm}

\structure{Solution:} Take the convolution inverse of $\hat{x}$ to reconstruct the signal. 
\end{frame}

\section{Problem Approach and Steps} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Problem Simulation}
\structure{Specify the main ingredients of simulated measurement system:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Finitely supported point spread function (influence function), 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Symmetric case: $a_i = \frac 1{10}$ for $|i| < 15$.  
    \item Asymmetric case: $a_i = \frac 2{10} e^{-i/40}$ for $0\le i\le 40$.
  \end{itemize}
\item The covariance function $\phi$ for the signal $x$ is given by 
$$
\phi = \mathrm{Cov}\,(x) = b*b^{*}
$$
  where $b_i = \frac {21}{100}(1-|i|)$ for $|i| \le 7$. 
\item Measurement noise is modeled with a zero mean Gaussian $\nu$ with a specified $\sigma^2 = \frac 1{100}$.
\item Finally, the data is given by
$$
  y = a * x + \nu
$$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Reconstruction Operator $R$}  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Following Lecture 13, we seek a reconstruction operator $R$ that is given by convolution with $r$ supported on a specified interval $\Delta$, so that $\widehat x = r*x$.
    \item Further, it was shown that
    $$
      H(r) = E( \widehat x - x )^2 = \langle P (r - P^{-1}q), r- P^{-1}q \rangle_{\Delta} + f_0 - \langle q, P^{-1}q\rangle_{\Delta}
    $$
    where $P$ is the operator associated with convolution by $p = a*\phi*a^* + \sigma^2\delta$ and $q = a*\phi$.
    \item So, for a given $\Delta$, the reconstruction kernel is uniquely determined by \alert{$r = P^{-1}q$}, and 
    $$
      \mathrm{Var}\, \widehat x = H_{min} = \alert{f_0 - \langle q, r\rangle_{\Delta}}.
    $$
  \end{itemize}
